# Top Down -> Memoization
    1. Uses recursion
    2. Not fast or efficient enough
    3. Used for quick solution

- Recipe
    1. Make it work
       - Visualize the problem as a tree
       - Implement tree using recursion
       - Test it
    2. Make it efficient
       - add a memo object: needs to have keys representing arguments to the function 
       - and values of the object represents the return value for the function calls
       - add a base case to return memo value
       - store return values into the memo
