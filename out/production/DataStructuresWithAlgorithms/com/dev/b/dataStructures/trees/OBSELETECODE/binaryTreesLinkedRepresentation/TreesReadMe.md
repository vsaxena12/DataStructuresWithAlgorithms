## Types of Binary Trees

1. Full Binary Tress -> Each non-leaf NODE has 0 or 2 children.
2. Perfect Binary Tress -> All non-leaf NODE has 2 children.
3. Complete Binary Trees -> All non-leaf NODES are completely filled and the last level should be at as left as possible in 
such a way that if all the NODES are represented in an array, there should be no space in between
4. Balanced Binary Tree -> All leaf NODES are at the same distance from the ROOT NODE

## Representing Trees using Arrays and Linked List

### Arrays
If Element is at I, then Left Child is 2I and Right Child is 2I+1
Here, array will start from 1 and not 0 for making mathematical operations easier.  


### Linked List


### Steps to create, insert, delete, search and traverse binary tree using a linked representation
1. Create a Binary Node having element, left child node and right child node. 
2. 



## Depth First Search
1. Pre-Order Traversal -> Node, Left, Right
2. In-Order Traversal -> Left, Node, Right
3. Post-Order Traversal -> left, Right, Node

## Breath First Search
1. Level Order Traversal -> Create a Queue data structure to store the current node and traverse it accordingly.
