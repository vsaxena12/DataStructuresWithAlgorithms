# Singly Linked List: Time followed by Space Complexity

1. Insert At Head -> O(1) O(1)
2. Insert At Tail -> O(1) O(1)
3. Insert At Index -> O(n) O(1) 
4. size -> O(1) O(1)
5. Get Element -> O(n) O(1)
6. Delete At Head -> O(1) O(1)
7. Delete At Tail -> O(1) O(1)
8. Delete At Index -> O(n) O(1)


Can we create s doubly linked list using one pointer with every node? Yes using XOR bit manipulation
